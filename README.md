In this code, the performance of CNN-tGCN is compared with a traditional graph convolutional network (GCN) as a baseline, using different values of "k" in the range {4, 6, 8, 10, 12}.
It shows the classification results obtained by CNN-tGCN with different number of neighboring nodes in the given data set. The optimal "k" value in k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) graph construction is determined based on the best performance obtained by CNN-tGCN.
The experimental results show a trend in which the performance first improves and then decreases as the number of neighboring nodes increases. It can be seen that a graph made with a small number of adjacent nodes cannot adequately capture the spatial features of histopathological images. On the contrary, a large number of neighborhood nodes leads to feature redundancy in the graph, thereby reducing performance.
In this experiment, the best performance of CNN-tGCN is achieved when the value of 'k' is equal to 8, which indicates that considering the eight nearest neighbor nodes in the graph structure provides an optimal balance between capturing spatial features and avoiding feature redundancy. he does.
